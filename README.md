# 🛠️ Staking Contract Template

A reusable and beginner-friendly smart contract template for staking ERC-20 tokens.  
Designed to help Web3 developers quickly build decentralized staking systems with minimal setup.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Basic staking logic (stake, withdraw, get rewards)
- ✅ Unit tested with Hardhat and Chai
- ✅ Easy deployment with script
- ✅ Modular and clean project structure
- ✅ Ready to expand for more advanced staking logic

## 📂 Project Structure
```

**File Descriptions:**

- `Staking.sol` – Main staking smart contract  
- `deploy.js` – Deployment script using Hardhat  
- `Staking.test.js` – Unit tests for the staking logic  
- `.gitignore` – Prevents unnecessary files (e.g. `node_modules/`) from being pushed to GitHub  

---

## 🧾 Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16+
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

## ⚙️ Getting Started
### 1. Install

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tesnetra/staking-contract-template.git
cd staking-contract-template
npm install
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage
### 1. Compile Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```
### 2. Run Tests
```bash
npx hardhat test
```
### 3. Deploy to Local Network
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
You can update the deployment script or hardhat.config.js to deploy to other networks (e.g., testnet or mainnet).

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Token staking in DeFi applications
- Loyalty or reward mechanisms for NFT or dApp ecosystems
- Bootstrapping new token ecosystems with incentivized locking

---

## 📜 Example Usage

### 1. Users can stake tokens using:
```bash
stake(uint256 amount)
```
### 2. Rewards are claimed with:
```bash
claimReward()
```
### 3. Funds can be withdrawn via:
```bash
withdraw(uint256 amount)
```
Integrate this with dApp frontends using ethers.js or web3.js.

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- For learning and prototyping only — not audited
- Use libraries like OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20, Ownable, etc., in production
- Always test thoroughly and audit before going live
